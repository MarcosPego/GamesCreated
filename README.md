# Games Created

This is the repository that has the builds and games created during the course of the master's degree in Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico

## Shooter Game

This game was created for a 3d Programing course which aimed to test and understand ligting fundamentals in games and scenes. The project was done by three students and the theme of the game was free to choose. We decided to create a first person shooter gun as we found it was a good way to higlight the scene in addition to imrove our game development scenes.

### How we built it

* The game was built in unity using the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) for better lighting and graphic fidelity.
* Some assets were hand made in blender and given custom made materials using Unity's shader graph.
* The assests that were imported from the asset store were added materials with custom normal maps to increase lighting quality.

 Ashrune's Ascencion is a short prototype of an Hack and Slash with some rogue-like elements that focuses on the rise of the Sword of Ashrune out of the Arena.
 The goal was having an elemental sword that could be customized to better fight the various enemies the player would encounter.
 This project was created by three IT students with the cooperation of two art studends.
