# Games Created

This is the repository that has the builds and games created during the course of the master's degree in Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico

## Shooter Game

This game was created for a 3d Programing course which aimed to test and understand ligting fundamentals in games and scenes. The project was done by three students and the theme of the game was free to choose. We decided to create a first person shooter gun as we found it was a good way to higlight the scene in addition to improve our game development scenes.

I mostly contributed with player movement and behaviour, level design, weapon design and implementation and particle effects. As well as the portal effect.

### Snapshots

The course was mainly focused on lighting and graphic quality so one of the focuses of the game was adding bloom, ambient occlusion, lens flare and the use of normal mapping and high quality textures.

In addition, there was a focus on particle-effects, such as lasers, bomb explosions and others.

A portal that could show live the other side of it was also a good addition to the game in regards to realism and overall quality.

### How we built it

* The game was built in unity using the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) for better lighting and graphic fidelity.
* Some assets were hand made in blender and given custom made materials using Unity's shader graph.
* The assests that were imported from the asset store were added materials with custom normal maps to increase lighting quality.

 ### What I learned
 
 This project entailed a lot of complicated features regarding HDRP and overall graphic quality. But the most challenging one was for sure the portal effect. Being able to properly render each side of the scene meant having two extra cameras that followed properly the player's prespective compared to his position to the portal, render this prespective to a texture and render this texture the plane of each portal side.
 
 In this project I also assumed the role of team leader and delegated task to my colleagues based on their capabilities and interests.

 
 ## Ashrune's Ascencion

 Ashrune's Ascencion is a short prototype of an Hack and Slash with some rogue-like elements that focuses on the rise of the Sword of Ashrune out of the Arena.
 The goal was having an elemental sword that could be customized to better fight the various enemies the player would encounter.
 This project was created by three IT students with the cooperation of two art studends.
 
 I mostly contributed with player movement and behaviour, as well as animation, level design, weapon design and implementation and particle effects. I also implemented some of the enemies such as the golem and the boss.

 ### How we built it

* The game was built in unity using the Universal Render Pipeline (URP).
* Some assets were made by our art team

Being able to properly render each side of the scene meant having two extra cameras that followed properly the player's prespective compared to his position to the portal, render this prespective to a texture and render this texture the plane of each portal side.
 
 In this project I also assumed the role of team leader and given the drop out of the initial four elements of the team, I had to surpass challenges and guide my team to achieve our goals by delegating tasks and helping my colleagues when needed as we were short one member.
 
 The project also proved to be over scopped and to complex for three students to completly implement in such a short amount of time, and helped me understand for future situations the need of proper scopping in projects. Regardless we are pround of the result and believe we created a good hack and slash rouge-like experience.
